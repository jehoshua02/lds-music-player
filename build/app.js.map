selection of sacred hymns for the Church: “For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads” (<a class=\\\"scripture-ref\\\" href=\\\"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/25.12\\\">D&amp;C 25:12</a>).</p>\\r\\n<p>Now, 150 years after the first hymnbook was published by the Church, we are pleased to present this revision. Many hymns found in our original hymnbook and in subsequent editions are included, as are a number of newly added hymns.

The hymns invite the Spirit of the Lord, create a feeling of reverence, unify us as members, and provide a way for us to offer praises to the Lord.</p>\\r\\n    <p>Some of the greatest sermons are preached by the singing of hymns. Hymns move us to repentance and good works, build testimony and faith, comfort the weary, console the mourning, and inspire us to endure to the end.</p>\\r\\n    <p>We hope to see an increase of hymn singing in our congregations. We encourage all members, whether musically inclined or not, to join with us in singing the hymns. We hope leaders, teachers, and members who are called on to speak will turn often to the hymnbook to find sermons presented powerfully and beautifully in verse.</p>\\r\\n    <p>Latter-day Saints have a long tradition of choir singing. Every ward and branch in the Church should have a choir that performs regularly. We encourage choirs to use the hymnbook as their basic resource.</p>\\r\\n</section>\\r\\n<section>\\r\\n    <header>\\r\\n        <p class=\\\"title\\\">Music in Our Homes</p>\\r\\n    </header>\\r\\n    <p>Music has boundless powers for moving families toward greater spirituality and devotion to the gospel. Latter-day Saints should fill their homes with the sound of worthy music.</p>\\r\\n    <p>Ours is a hymnbook for the home as well as for the meetinghouse. We hope the hymnbook will take a prominent place among the scriptures and other religious books in our homes. The hymns can bring families a spirit of beauty and peace and can inspire love and unity among family members.</p>\\r\\n    <p>Teach your children to love the hymns. Sing them on the Sabbath, in home evening, during scripture study, at prayer time. Sing as you work, as you play, and as you travel together. Sing hymns as lullabies to build faith and testimony in your young ones.</p>\\r\\n</section>\\r\\n<section>\\r\\n    <header>\\r\\n        <p class=\\\"title\\\">Music in Our Personal Lives</p>\\r\\n    </header>\\r\\n    <p>In addition to blessing us as Church and family members, the hymns can greatly benefit us as individuals. Hymns can lift our spirits, give us courage, and move us to righteous action. They can fill our souls with heavenly thoughts and bring us a spirit of peace.</p>\\r\\n    <p>Hymns can also help us withstand the temptations of the adversary. We encourage you to memorize your favorite hymns and study the scriptures that relate to them. Then, if unworthy thoughts enter your mind, sing a hymn to yourself, crowding out the evil with the good.</p>\\r\\n    <p>Brothers and sisters, let us use the hymns to invite the Spirit of the Lord into our congregations, our homes, and our personal lives. Let us memorize and ponder them, recite and sing them, and partake of their spiritual nourishment. Know that the song of the righteous is a prayer unto our Father in Heaven, “and it shall be answered with a blessing upon [your] heads.”</p>\\r\\n</section>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"closing-block\\\">\\r\\n    <p class=\\\"signature\\\">The First Presidency</p>\\r\\n</div>\",\n\t\t\t\"section\": \"frontmatter\",\n\t\t\t\"title\": \"First Presidency Preface\",\n\t\t\t\"uri\": \"/manual/hymns/first-presidency-preface\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"html\": \"<p>The following material is intended to help you use the hymnbook effectively.

For a congregational hymn in priesthood meeting, it is generally preferable to choose from the standard congregational hymns or from those marked <em>Men.</em></p>\\r\\n        <p>Several hymns are specifically arranged for men’s choirs; in addition, many hymns for congregations and those marked <em>Men</em> can be adapted for use by men’s choirs and quartets:</p>\\r\\n        <figure class=\\\"image\\\">\\r\\n            <img src=\\\"tchg-pix.nfo:o:1eb1.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Hymn showing what men sing\\\" />\\r\\n            <figcaption>\\r\\n                <p><em>Baritones:</em> <br />Sing melody</p>\\r\\n                <p><em>1st Tenors:</em> <br />Sing alto above the melody</p>\\r\\n                <p><em>2nd Tenors:</em> <br />Sing Tenor</p>\\r\\n                <p><em>Basses:</em> <br />Sing Bass</p>\\r\\n            </figcaption>\\r\\n        </figure>\\r\\n        <p>The main problem in adapting hymns for a men’s choir is finding tenors who can sing as high as the alto may go; some high notes may need to be adapted. You may also transpose the hymn to a lower key, adapting the bass part.</p>\\r\\n        <p>For an example of an adaptation in the hymnbook, compare <a class=\\\"cross-ref\\\" href=\\\"/manual/hymns/should-you-feel-inclined-to-censure\\\">“Should You Feel Inclined to Censure”</a> (no. 235), a congregational arrangement, with <a class=\\\"cross-ref\\\" href=\\\"/manual/hymns/brightly-beams-our-fathers-mercy-mens-choir\\\">“Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy”</a> (no. 335), the same music arranged for men’s voices.</p>\\r\\n        <p>Another possibility in adapting a hymn for a men’s choir is to have the alto part sung below the melody. When this is done, the bass part is optional.</p>\\r\\n        <p>You will note that in the hymns arranged for men’s choirs, a tenor clef symbol is used instead of the usual treble clef symbol.

You can sing some of these songs to show thankfulness to Heavenly Father and some just for the fun of singing.</p>\\r\\n<p>As you sing you may feel good inside. The Holy Ghost gives you warm feelings to help you understand that the words and messages in the songs are true. You can learn about the gospel in this way, and your testimony will grow as you learn. You will remember more easily what you have learned when you sing about it. The melody of a song helps you remember the words and also brings the feeling of the song to your heart. The illustrations will also help you see what the songs teach. Once you know the songs, they can be with you always (like good friends) to help you make right choices and be happy.</p>\\r\\n<p>Music is a language that everyone can understand. Children all over the world sing these same songs. Music can also link the past to the future. Someday you might sing these songs with your own children.</p>\\r\\n<p>There are songs in this book on almost every gospel subject. The songs explain our beliefs about life in heaven; about prayer, thankfulness, and reverence; about the mission of the Savior; about the principles of the gospel; about the importance of home, family, and heritage; about the beauty of nature and the seasons; and about the need for fun and activity. The last section is music that can be played before or after a meeting—or in your home—to create a reverent atmosphere.</p>\\r\\n<p>Someday you will be leaders of the Church and of the world. What you learn from these songs will help you to be faithful and to serve righteously. The good feelings the songs bring will give you happiness and courage and will help you to remember that you are children of God.</p>\",\n\t\t\t\"section\": \"frontmatter\",\n\t\t\t\"title\": \"Preface\",\n\t\t\t\"uri\": \"/manual/childrens-songbook/preface\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"html\": \"\",\n\t\t\t\"section\": \"frontmatter\",\n\t\t\t\"title\": \"Contents\",\n\t\t\t\"uri\": \"/manual/childrens-songbook/contents\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"html\": \"<p>The purpose of this songbook is to teach children the gospel of Jesus Christ through music.
